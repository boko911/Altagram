# Altagram Coding Challenge

Small python flask app that retrieve the hyperdrive rank of the Starwars spaceships.
Due to computer issues(not at home, using mom's computer), I did not include Postgres into this challenge and used only list to store the results.

### Installation

Install the dependencies and run the app

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/boko911/Altagram.git
$ cd Altagram/app
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python app.py
```
